# Arduino-based-automatic-robot-for-agriculture Sector 
The Arduino-based agriculture robot is a project designed to automate various tasks involved in farming, particularly watering, manure distribution, and obstacle avoidance. 

The objective of this research work was to develop a low-cost agricultural robot to spray water and pesticides in agriculture fields as well as for general crop monitoring. The prototype system is a four-wheeled robot that consists of a spraying mechanism.Tests conducted on the agricultural robot prototype showed that it could perform as required under real-world usage scenarios. While the productivity of the robot in terms of crop coverage is slightly lower than a human worker, the labour cost savings afforded by the agricultural robot prototype is much greater as it functions completely in an autonomous mode and only requires the operatorâ€™s control to place the robot at the start of the crop path.

Furthermore, the agricultural robot prototype targets and sprays the liquid fertilizer and water only on the plants and not in the spaces between individual plants, as opposed to the human workers with knapsack sprayer that flood the entire crop path with liquid fertilizer and pesticide. Thus, the prototype system is able to not only reduce the labour requirements and costs, but also result in greater resource savings and reduction of the contamination in underground water sources due to 
leeching process. 

The results are rather respectable, as a regular water and pesticide spraying shift with human workers lasts 3 hours with a break of 2 hours in between consecutive shifts over an 8-hour 
workday. As such, the agricultural robot prototype can last for up to two shifts and be recharged during the shift break. Thus, there will not be an increase in the operation times and reduction in the efficiency of the fertilizer and pesticide spraying process due to the recharging times when human workers are replaced. 

While the prototype system has successfully achieved its objective of reducing the labour requirements and costs for the fertilizer and pesticide spraying process, one recommendation has been identified for future work. By making the robot fully autonomous, by using either a rail- or line-following system, the labour costs can be further reduced as an operator is not required to manually steer the robot to each crop path.
