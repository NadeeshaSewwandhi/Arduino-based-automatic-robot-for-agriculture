# Arduino based automatic robot for agriculture Sector 
# Introduction
The Arduino-based agriculture robot is a project designed to automate various tasks involved in farming, particularly watering, manure distribution, and obstacle avoidance. 

The objective of this research work was to develop a low-cost agricultural robot to spray water and pesticides in agriculture fields as well as for general crop monitoring. The prototype system is a four-wheeled robot that consists of a spraying mechanism.Tests conducted on the agricultural robot prototype showed that it could perform as required under real-world usage scenarios. While the productivity of the robot in terms of crop coverage is slightly lower than a human worker, the labour cost savings afforded by the agricultural robot prototype is much greater as it functions completely in an autonomous mode and only requires the operatorâ€™s control to place the robot at the start of the crop path.

Furthermore, the agricultural robot prototype targets and sprays the liquid fertilizer and water only on the plants and not in the spaces between individual plants, as opposed to the human workers with knapsack sprayer that flood the entire crop path with liquid fertilizer and pesticide. Thus, the prototype system is able to not only reduce the labour requirements and costs, but also result in greater resource savings and reduction of the contamination in underground water sources due to 
leeching process. 

The results are rather respectable, as a regular water and pesticide spraying shift with human workers lasts 3 hours with a break of 2 hours in between consecutive shifts over an 8-hour 
workday. As such, the agricultural robot prototype can last for up to two shifts and be recharged during the shift break. Thus, there will not be an increase in the operation times and reduction in the efficiency of the fertilizer and pesticide spraying process due to the recharging times when human workers are replaced. 


# System Requirements : 
Arduino UNO, Bread Board, DC Motor, Ultrasonic Sensor,Servo Motor , IR Sensors,  External Power Source, Arduino Software.


# Operating the Robot

## Placement and Initialization:

Position the robot at the starting point of the crop row.
Power on the robot to initialize its sensors and motors.
## Manual Navigation:

Use the remote control to direct the robot to the desired set of plants.
Ensure you guide the robot carefully to avoid obstacles and to reach the correct plant locations.
## Obstacle Detection:

The robot is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles in its path.
If the robot detects an obstacle, it will alert you or make adjustments to navigate around it.
## Plant Detection:

Once the robot is in the target area, it uses IR sensors to detect individual plants.
The IR sensors help the robot identify plants based on their presence in the field.
## Spraying Mechanism:

Align the robot with the plant you wish to spray.
Activate the spraying mechanism using the controls.
The servo motor will adjust the spray nozzle to accurately target the plant.
The robot will then apply water or pesticides directly to the plant.
## Continuing the Process:

After spraying one plant, manually direct the robot to the next plant or set of plants.
Repeat the process of positioning, detecting, and spraying for each plant as needed.
## Row Completion and Navigation:

Once a row is completed, you can move the robot to a new row or return it to its charging station.
Ensure the robot is recharged and maintained as necessary between tasks.
## Maintenance and Charging
After completing its tasks or when the battery is low, guide the robot to the designated charging station.
Recharge the robot and perform any required maintenance to ensure it remains in good working condition.
